h1. getHomepage

Retrieves the user's home page. Useful for tracking purposes.
Only works in Firefox and IE (yet).
Also it only gives the homepage url when it's on the same domain.
Means that _http://google.com/foo_ itself could check whether _http://google.com_ is set as homepage but not _http://yahoo.com_.

h2. Example

bc. getHomepage(function(url) { alert("Your homepage is: " + url); });
